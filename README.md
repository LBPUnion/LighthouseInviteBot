# Lighthouse Invite Bot
A Discord bot for inviting users to a closed instance of [Project Lighthouse](https://github.com/LBPUnion/ProjectLighthouse). It is a self contained go application that creates it's default config on first run. There is an example Systemd service file in the repo. 
It requires an API key from an instance of Lighthouse, this can be aquired from the admin panel, it also needs the URL of the instance. 
It also displays statistics about the server, though this can be turned off in the config
